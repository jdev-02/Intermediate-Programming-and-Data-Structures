//a prime is picked from set of all primes not exceeding N
//prime is written in binary ontation and player guesses it bit by bit starting at LSB
//player gets one point for each correct bit that guess
//immediately after each guess, player is informed whether their guess was correct
//also informed whether is was the last bit in the number - showing you made it to the end of the game
//E(N) is expected number of points for maximizing the score
	//e(10) =2 bc 10 is 1010 and you could guess all 1s
